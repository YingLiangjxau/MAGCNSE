>MAGCNSE: predicting lncRNA-disease associations using multi-view attention graph convolutional network and stacking ensemble model

## Data
The lncRNA-disease associations are collected from LncRNADisease v2.0(http://www.rnanut.net/lncrnadisease/), the DOIDs of diseases are obtained from Disease Ontology(https://disease-ontology.org/), the sequences of lncRNAs are obtained from NONCODE v6.0(http://www.noncode.org/).
